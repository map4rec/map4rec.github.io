  "about.description": "<p class=\"mb-2\"><span class=\"font-bold\">Mapping for Recreation</span> is a growing citizen science project that invites children and youth to share how they experience outdoor recreation spaces — from parks and playgrounds to quiet corners of nature.</p><p class=\"mb-2\">It began in 2023 in the Netherlands with temporarily displaced children from Ukraine, but is not growing into something bigger: a way to make children’s perspectives on urban spaces visible in urban design and planning, supporting the idea of Child-Friendly Cities.</p><p class=\"mb-2\">The current map shows places explored in the Netherlands, and includes children’s impressions of activities, safety, nature, aesthetics, and ideas for how spaces could be improved. Each location reflects their honest opinions — what they liked, disliked, and how they would transform it.</p>",
